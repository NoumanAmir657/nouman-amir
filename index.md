    # Compiler Engineer & Optimization Specialist

    <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a dedicated **Compiler Engineer** with 1.5 years of experience specializing in high-performance code generation and optimization for **RISC-V Vector Architectures**.</p>

    <p>I focus on low-level performance and leveraging modern compiler infrastructure, including **LLVM**, **IREE**, and **MLIR**, to build fast, efficient software solutions. I'm passionate about the intersection of hardware and software and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in embedded and accelerated computing environments.</p>

    <p>I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and I'm always keen to chat about new compiler projects or optimization techniques!</p>
